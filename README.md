# Salesforce Lightning Web Component Specialist Project

### Components for the "Friend Ships" lightning application found in 'force-app/main/default/lwc' directory

Utilizing the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS), I've constructed a CRM application using functional Lightning web components. 

The application uses mock data provided by the Salesforce Trailhead program.

## Use Case

A hypothetical boat-sharing company needs an application that enables sales associates to enter information about their customers' boats, including the boat's location. An area to allow team members to post comments and ratings about their experiences is desired.
